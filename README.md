## Overview

Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language, widely used in various fields such as data science, web development, and machine learning. This repository showcases the foundational topics I have learned and practiced, including Python syntax, object-oriented programming, and data visualization.

## Topics Covered

- **Python Basics**:

  - Syntax and structure
  - Variables and data types
  - Conditional statements and loops

- **Data Structures**:

  - Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:

  - Classes and objects
  - Inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism

- **File Handling**:

  - Reading and writing files

## Libraries

I explored the following Python libraries:

- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and array manipulation
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization
- **Matplotlib**: For basic data plotting and visualizations
